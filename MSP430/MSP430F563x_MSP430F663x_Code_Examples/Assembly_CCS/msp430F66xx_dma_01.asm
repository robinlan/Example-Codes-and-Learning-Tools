;                        MSP430 CODE EXAMPLE DISCLAIMER
; 
;  MSP430 code examples are self-contained low-level programs that typically
;  demonstrate a single peripheral function or device feature in a highly
;  concise manner. For this the code may rely on the device's power-on default
;  register values and settings such as the clock configuration and care must
;  be taken when combining code from several examples to avoid potential side
;  effects. Also see www.ti.com/grace for a GUI- and www.ti.com/msp430ware
;  for an API functional library-approach to peripheral configuration.

;  MSP430F66xx Demo - DMA0, Repeated Block to-from RAM, Software Trigger
;
;  Description: A 16 word block from 1C00-1C1Fh is transfered to 1C20h-1C3fh
;  using DMA0 in a burst block using software DMAREQ trigger.
;  After each transfer, source, destination and DMA size are
;  reset to inital software setting because DMA transfer mode 5 is used.
;  P1.0 is toggled durring DMA transfer only for demonstration purposes.
;  ** RAM location 0x1C00 - 0x1C3F used - make sure no compiler conflict **
;  ACLK = REFO = 32kHz, MCLK = SMCLK = default DCO 1048576Hz
