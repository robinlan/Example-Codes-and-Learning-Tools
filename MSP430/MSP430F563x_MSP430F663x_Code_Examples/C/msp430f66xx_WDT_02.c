 *                       MSP430 CODE EXAMPLE DISCLAIMER
 *
 * MSP430 code examples are self-contained low-level programs that typically
 * demonstrate a single peripheral function or device feature in a highly
 * concise manner. For this the code may rely on the device's power-on default
 * register values and settings such as the clock configuration and care must
 * be taken when combining code from several examples to avoid potential side
 * effects. Also see www.ti.com/grace for a GUI- and www.ti.com/msp430ware
 * for an API functional library-approach to peripheral configuration.

//   MSP430F66x Demo - WDT, Toggle P1.0, Interval Overflow ISR, 32kHz ACLK
//
//  Description: Toggle P1.0 using software timed by WDT ISR. Toggle rate is
//  exactly 250ms based on 32kHz ACLK WDT clock source. In this example the
//  WDT is configured to divide 32768 watch-crystal(2^15) by 2^13 with an ISR
//  triggered @ 4Hz = [WDT CLK source/32768].
//  ACLK = REFO , MCLK = SMCLK = default DCO ~1.045MHz
