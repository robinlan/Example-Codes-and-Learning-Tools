 *                       MSP430 CODE EXAMPLE DISCLAIMER
 *
 * MSP430 code examples are self-contained low-level programs that typically
 * demonstrate a single peripheral function or device feature in a highly
 * concise manner. For this the code may rely on the device's power-on default
 * register values and settings such as the clock configuration and care must
 * be taken when combining code from several examples to avoid potential side
 * effects. Also see www.ti.com/grace for a GUI- and www.ti.com/msp430ware
 * for an API functional library-approach to peripheral configuration.

//   MSP430F66x Demo - 32x32 Signed Multiply
//
//   Description: Hardware multiplier is used to multiply two numbers.
//   The calculation is automatically initiated after the second operand is
//   loaded. Results are stored in RES0, RES1, RES2 and RES3.
//
//   ACLK = REFO, MCLK = SMCLK = default DCO
