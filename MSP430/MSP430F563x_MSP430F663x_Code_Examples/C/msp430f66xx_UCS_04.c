 *                       MSP430 CODE EXAMPLE DISCLAIMER
 *
 * MSP430 code examples are self-contained low-level programs that typically
 * demonstrate a single peripheral function or device feature in a highly
 * concise manner. For this the code may rely on the device's power-on default
 * register values and settings such as the clock configuration and care must
 * be taken when combining code from several examples to avoid potential side
 * effects. Also see www.ti.com/grace for a GUI- and www.ti.com/msp430ware
 * for an API functional library-approach to peripheral configuration.

//  MSP430F66x Demo - FLL+, Runs Internal DCO at 2.45MHz
//
//  Description: This program demonstrates setting the internal DCO to run at
//  2.45MHz with auto-calibration by the FLL+ circuitry.
//  ACLK = XT1 = 32768Hz, MCLK = SMCLK = DCO = (74+1) x REFO = 2457600Hz
