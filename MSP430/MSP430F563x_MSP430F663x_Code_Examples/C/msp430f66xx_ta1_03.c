 *                       MSP430 CODE EXAMPLE DISCLAIMER
 *
 * MSP430 code examples are self-contained low-level programs that typically
 * demonstrate a single peripheral function or device feature in a highly
 * concise manner. For this the code may rely on the device's power-on default
 * register values and settings such as the clock configuration and care must
 * be taken when combining code from several examples to avoid potential side
 * effects. Also see www.ti.com/grace for a GUI- and www.ti.com/msp430ware
 * for an API functional library-approach to peripheral configuration.

//  MSP430F66x Demo - Timer1_A3, Toggle P1.0, Overflow ISR, DCO SMCLK
//
//  Description: Toggle P1.0 using software and Timer1_A overflow ISR.
//  In this example an ISR triggers when TA overflows. Inside the TA
//  overflow ISR P1.0 is toggled. Toggle rate is approximatlely 16.6Hz.
//  Proper use of the TAIV interrupt vector generator is demonstrated.
//  ACLK = n/a, MCLK = SMCLK = TACLK = default DCO ~1.05MHz
